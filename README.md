# Deep Learning Object Detection with YOLOv5

This repository demonstrates how to leverage **YOLOv5**, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for object detection tasks using a custom dataset. YOLOv5 is an efficient, real-time object detection algorithm based on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, widely used in computer vision tasks. This project includes steps for setting up the environment, preparing the dataset, configuring the model, training the model, and evaluating the performance.

## Introduction

In this project, we utilize **YOLOv5** (You Only Look Once v5) to detect objects in images. The model is a **deep learning architecture** specifically designed for **real-time object detection**. YOLOv5 improves upon previous versions of YOLO with faster inference time, better accuracy, and more flexible architecture. This project focuses on training YOLOv5 with a custom dataset using the **Roboflow** platform, which simplifies dataset preparation, annotation, and integration into the YOLOv5 framework.

The project demonstrates:
- **Deep Learning for Computer Vision**: Using YOLOv5 to detect objects in images.
- **Custom Object Detection**: Training the model on your own labeled dataset.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From dataset creation to model deployment.

## Background

### Object Detection and YOLOv5

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and classifying objects within an image, as well as predicting their locations via bounding boxes. Deep learning-based object detection models, such as **YOLO** (You Only Look Once), have revolutionized this task due to their speed and accuracy.

YOLOv5 is an improved version of the original YOLO algorithm, using a **CNN** for feature extraction and a **bounding box regression** for object localization. YOLOv5 is known for:
- **Speed**: Fast inference time suitable for real-time applications.
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy in detecting multiple objects within an image.
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale and handle different input sizes, classes, and training parameters.

The YOLOv5 architecture consists of:
- **Backbone**: A series of convolutional layers that extract features from the input image.
- **Head**: A series of layers that use the extracted features to predict bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects.
