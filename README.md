# YOLOv5 Custom Object Detection with Roboflow

This repository demonstrates how to train a custom YOLOv5 model for object detection using a dataset from **Roboflow**. The project utilizes the YOLOv5 architecture, which is a state-of-the-art model for real-time object detection, to detect objects in images. The pipeline includes data collection, model configuration, training, and result evaluation.

## Introduction

This project leverages **YOLOv5** for object detection, a highly efficient and accurate model for real-time object detection tasks. It integrates with **Roboflow**, a platform for dataset management, to download a custom dataset and train the YOLOv5 model from scratch.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Train a YOLOv5 model for detecting custom objects in images.
- **Custom Dataset Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with **Roboflow** to download labeled datasets.
- **Model Configuration Flexibility**: Easily adapt the YOLOv5 architecture for specific use cases and object classes.
- **Training Monitoring**: Visualize training progress using **TensorBoard**.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Python 3.8** or higher
- **PyTorch** with GPU support (if available)
- **Roboflow Python Library** for dataset management
- **YOLOv5** repository for model training and inference

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the YOLOv5 Repository**  
   Clone the YOLOv5 repository to your local machine or environment.

2. **Install Required Dependencies**  
   Install the necessary dependencies using `pip`, including PyTorch, OpenCV, and Roboflow, by following the instructions in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. **Install the Roboflow Library**  
   Use the Roboflow Python API to download the dataset from Roboflow. You'll need to sign up for an API key from Roboflow.

4. **Download the Dataset**  
   Use the **Roboflow** API to download your dataset in the YOLOv5 format. This dataset will include both the training and validation sets for your custom object detection task.

## Dataset

This project uses a **custom object detection dataset**. You can upload your own dataset to **Roboflow** or use an existing dataset provided on the platform. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets and is labeled according to your specific object detection classes.

### Dataset Format:
- The dataset is compatible with YOLOv5's format.
- The dataset metadata is stored in a `data.yaml` file, which includes:
  - The path to the images for training, validation, and testing.
  - The number of object classes (`nc`).
  - The class names (e.g., `apple`, `banana`, etc.).

## Model Configuration

YOLOv5 provides flexible model configurations to suit different datasets and tasks. In this project, we modify the base YOLOv5 model architecture (`yolov5s.yaml`) to fit the custom dataset.

### Key Model Parameters:
- **`nc`**: The number of classes in the dataset (e.g., if detecting fruits, `nc` could be 3 for `apple`, `banana`, and `orange`).
- **`depth_multiple`**: This parameter controls the depth (number of layers) of the network.
- **`width_multiple`**: This parameter adjusts the width of the network layers (the number of channels).
- **Anchors**: Defined for different feature map scales to improve bounding box predictions.

## Training the Model

After setting up the dataset and configuring the model, you can start training the YOLOv5 model. The training process involves feeding the dataset through the model and updating the weights to minimize the error in predictions. The model can be trained for multiple epochs, with the training results saved in logs for further analysis.

### Key Training Parameters:
- **Image Size**: The size of input images to the model (e.g., `416x416` pixels).
- **Batch Size**: The number of images processed in a single pass through the network.
- **Epochs**: The number of times the model will be trained on the dataset.

During training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset, and metrics such as loss, precision, recall, and mAP (mean average precision) are tracked.

---

## TensorBoard Visualization

TensorBoard is used to visualize the training process and monitor metrics such as loss, accuracy, and other performance indicators.

To start TensorBoard and visualize training metrics, run the following:

- Once training starts, open TensorBoard to inspect the training progress and performance metrics.
- Logs will be saved in the `runs/train/` directory.

---

## Results

After training, the results will be saved in a directory (`runs/train/`), and you can visualize the performance of the trained model on the validation dataset. You can view the results as images or plots, such as precision/recall curves or loss graphs.

- **Training Metrics**: Including loss, precision, recall, and mAP.
- **Result Images**: Example images from the validation set with predicted bounding boxes overlaid.
